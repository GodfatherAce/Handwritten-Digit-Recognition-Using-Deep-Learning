# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
This Python project Recognizes Handwritten digits using Artificial Neural Network

Requirements : Python 3.5,sklearn,opencv,numpy
> train.py file is used for training the model

> test.py file is used for Testing the model on test dataset,It picks up the model from model.pkl file

> model.pkl file is our trained Neural Network
